# Logbooks
This repo aims to facilitate the sharing of information, models, and datasets concerning logbooks in domain of particle accelerators. It serves as a hub for exchanging ideas, tools, and experiences 
by fostering an open and inclusive environment.

With the rapid advancements in NLP, this repository serves as a hub for exploring the potential applications of LLMs in logbook domains.  
By sharing datasets, model architectures, and evaluation methodologies, we aim to minimize duplicity.
